pegSolitare
===========

This is a simple peg solitare solver, written in C. It doesn't have much
usefulness, but was an interesting way to get some experience with hashtables,
bitwise operations, and the idea of a bitboard. 

It works backwards with a recursive search function. A hash table is used to store dead ends and keep from wasting time. Not much more to say.
